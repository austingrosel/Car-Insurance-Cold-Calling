# Car-Insurance-Cold-Calling

This repository contains a report I created for DePaul University's CSC 529 - Advanced Data Mining. In the report, I used different support vector machines and a random forest to build models for predicting if a customer would buy insurance after a phone call. This analysis used different variables like the customer's age, salary, the time of year they were contacted, etc. The R files have the machine learning implementation along with the exploratory data analysis using ggplot2.
